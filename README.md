## Task 01: Caesar Cipher

This project is part of the **Prodigy InfoTech Cyber Security Internship**.  
It demonstrates the implementation of the **Caesar Cipher** algorithm using Python to encrypt and decrypt text.

---

## 📌 Task Objective
To create a Python program that performs **encryption and decryption** using the Caesar Cipher technique based on a user-defined shift value.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Encrypts plain text using Caesar Cipher  
- Decrypts encrypted text back to original form  
- Supports uppercase and lowercase letters  
- Handles large shift values using modulo operation  
- Simple and user-friendly command-line interface  

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Program
1. Make sure Python is installed on your system  
2. Open terminal / PowerShell in the project folder  
3. Run the following command:

```bash
python caesar_cipher.py
🧪 Example
python
Copy code
Enter your message: rohit
Enter shift value: 3
Type 'encrypt' or 'decrypt': encrypt
Result: urklw
